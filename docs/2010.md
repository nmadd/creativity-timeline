My first experience managing large amounts of data happened almost accidentally. During college, midway through my senior year, I started a music website called 'FratMusic' with three friends. Although none of us were actually in a fraternity (and frankly had no interest in joining one), we noticed that the fraternities around our school paid local DJs to play at their parties. However, the DJs usually just played standard, top-40 hits. So we thought there might be an opportunity to create a better solution.

FratMusic began as a simple playlist. I would basically listen to the music that was being played on campus, scour the internet for good remixes and mashups of those songs, and add them to FratMusic.

After a few months, we added a new feature that allowed any college student to submit a playlist. The next thing we knew, our site unexpectedly started growing and turning into a burgeoning community of DJs and music lovers. By the time our college graduation approached, FratMusic had reached all fifty states and was getting over 80,000 unique users a day.
