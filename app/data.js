    text: `My first step into entrepreneurship happened almost accidentally. During college, midway through my senior year, I started a music website called 'FratMusic' with three friends. Although none of us were actually in a fraternity (and frankly had no interest in joining one), we noticed that the fraternities around our school paid local DJs to play at their parties. However, the DJs usually just played standard, top-40 hits. So we thought there might be an opportunity to create a better solution.

    FratMusic began as a simple playlist. I would basically listen to the music that was being played on campus, scour the internet for good remixes and mashups of those songs, and add them to FratMusic.

    After a few months, we added a new feature that allowed any college student to submit a playlist. The next thing we knew, our site unexpectedly started growing and turning into a burgeoning community of DJs and music lovers. By the time our college graduation approached, FratMusic had reached all fifty states and was getting over 80,000 unique users a day.

I led teams of designers and developers from initial concepts through finished products for both iOS and Android apps. Our iOS app did particularly well. {One or two sentences about selling iOS app, enough to keep us afloat} Over that time I gained invaluable experience in building a product and brand from the ground up.

When we started off the music market was pretty new, but it was now almost completely saturated. {By that time I was also starting to realize that I was reaching my limits, both technically and emotionally. }Plus, by that time I was over five years out of college, and I was having a harder and harder time feeling inspired by our mission.`,

    For the few years prior, while I had been running FratMusic, I had also been slowly exploring how to code. Coding combined two of my favorite things: writing and solving puzzles. {Something about how coding lets me display creativity} So in 2015, I made the difficult decision to move on from FratMusic and decided to take some time to explore my newfound interest in coding. And this time around, I also wanted to do something that had a mission that I really cared about.`,

    text: `After attending a four-month, in-person coding school, I stumbled upon a small, non-profit coding school in Queens NY that was focusing on teaching coding to underserved populations. I was immediately drawn in by their mission. Soon after, I began working as a web development instructor at Coalition for Queens, where I've gained experience in everything from building the overall arch of our curriculum, to creating daily lesson plans and schedules, to learning how to build a non-profit. {Creativity in a whole new sense}`,

    Ultimately, I would like a career where I use my information management and programming skillset to lead business strategy and innovation. Furthermore, I want to help take on the world's most pressing problems and do work for a mission that I believe in. I would love the opportunity to pursue this journey at Cornell Tech.`,
