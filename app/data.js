The rule at the station was you could basically play whatever you liked, as long as you had some sort of theme, and as long as you didn't play anything you'd normally hear on the radio.`,

    `I perhaps took that a little too literally. I decided to do a show called Campfire Singalongs, which only played experimental electronic music that didn't have any words. I also lived right next to the radio station, so I agreed to take any time slot available. I ended up with the primetime slot of Wednesday nights, from 11PM - 1AM.`,

  `Needless to say, I did not have many listeners. But I loved the experience of putting together a show, creating some type of connecting theme and story, and putting it out there for anybody who cared.`],

    `Midway through my senior year at University of Virginia, I started a music website called 'FratMusic' with three friends. Although none of us were actually in a fraternity, we noticed that the fraternities around our school paid local DJs to play at their parties. But the DJs usually just played standard, top-40 hits. So we thought there might be an opportunity to create a better solution. `],

    FratMusic began as a simple playlist. I would listen to the music that was being played on campus, scour the internet for good remixes and mashups of those songs, and add them to FratMusic.`,
    `After a few months, we added a new feature that allowed any college student to submit a playlist. The next thing we knew, our site unexpectedly started growing and turning into a burgeoning community of DJs and music lovers. By the time our college graduation approached, FratMusic had reached all fifty states and was getting over 80,000 unique users a day.

    `Over the course of about a year and a half, I led teams of designers and developers from initial concepts through finished products for both iOS and Android apps. Since we already had an established web presence, we decided to sell our apps, instead of release them for free. We ended up selling over 100,000 of them, which financed us over the next couple years.

    For the few years prior, while I had been running FratMusic, I had also been slowly exploring how to code. Coding combined two of my favorite things: writing and solving puzzles. So in 2015, I made the difficult decision to move on from FratMusic and decided to take some time to explore my newfound interest in coding. And this time around, I also wanted to do something that had a mission that I really cared about.`],
